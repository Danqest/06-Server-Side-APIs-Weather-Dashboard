# 06-Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

This project is an exercise in using server-side APIs and interacting with the html & css using that APIs.

The project involves interfacing with a openweathermap.org API using an API key, pulling information from the API, and displaying it dynamically on the page. Cities can be searched and saved, leading to a display of the current and 5-day forecasted weather conditions, including data on humidity, temperature, the UV Index, wind speed, and the overall weather.
